## Pull requests

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create [a feature request](https://github.com/indiebox/equality-desktop/discussions/new?category=ideas) to first discuss any significant new ideas. This includes things that related to Desktop Application (UI & UX).
